      Apart from the innovative teachings methods of
      manoj sir, The most interesting part is that
      groups will be created with different college
      students that helps us meet new people and
      share our ideas with them and we can learn with
      our team with everyones support and i got much
      more interest to learn with such a friendly
      environment that helped me learn many things
      from my team mates too.` ,
